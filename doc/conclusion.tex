\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment, the objective of analysing an RC circuit has been achieved. Static, time and frequency analyses have been performed both theoretically using the Octave maths tool and by circuit simulation using the Ngspice tool. The simulation results matched the theoretical results precisely. The reason for this near perfect match is the fact that this is a straightforward circuit containing only linear components, so the theoretical and simulation models cannot differ. In addition, the theoretical models used by Ngspice coincide with the models used by our group, therefore it wouldn't be expected a significant discrepancy in the obtained results. For more complex components, the theoretical and simulation models could differ but this is not the case in this work.
