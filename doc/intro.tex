% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a RC circuit containing linear components, 
such as resistors ($R_i$), dependent (rhombus shaped) voltage ($V$) and current ($I$) 
sources, a capacitor $C$ and a an independent (circle shaped) voltage source, as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:esq}, in which the nodes are ilustrated and the functions that define the sources are presented.


In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is
presented, using the \textit{Octave}. This analysis includes determining the currents through the branches and the voltages in the nodes for $t<0$, obtaining the equivalent resistance as seen from the capacitor terminals, determining the natural and forced solutions and superimposing them to determine the total solution for $t>0$, and performing a frequency analysis. 
In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, an analogous analysis is made through simulation, using \textit{Ngspice}, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in
Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in
Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
